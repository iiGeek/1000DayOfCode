# Day 3 – Inside the System ⚙️

## 📘 What I Learned Today
- The relationship between processes, threads, and daemons  
- How parent/child processes work and what PID 1 does  
- How the Linux kernel schedules CPU time and manages memory  
- The meaning of process priority, nice value, and system load  
- How ports and sockets work in networking  
- How Linux logs system activity using `journalctl`  

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice (Linux)
Commands I worked with today:

- `pstree -p`  
- `ps -ef`  
- `htop`  
- `free -h`  
- `vmstat 5`  
- `iostat`  
- `ss -tulnp`  
- `journalctl -xe`  

---

## 🔍 Concept Understanding
- How the kernel gives CPU time to each process  
- How RAM is allocated and why swapping happens  
- Why services run in the background and never stop  
- How ports act as “doors” for network traffic  
- What sockets are and how applications use them  
- How process trees determine system behavior  

---

## ✍️ Notes & Reflections
- Today was the first deep dive into Linux internals  
- Seeing live processes and system behavior made everything clearer  
- This knowledge builds the foundation for DevOps, automation, and system monitoring  
- One layer deeper than yesterday — and starting to think like an engineer

_One step today, stronger understanding for the next 997 days._
