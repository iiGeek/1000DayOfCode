# 1000DayOfCode 🚀

This repository documents my personal 1000-day journey of learning, coding, engineering fundamentals, and continuous improvement.  
The goal is simple: become a stronger, more complete engineer through consistency, discipline, and daily progress.

During these 1000 days, I will focus on deep learning, hands-on practice, and building real, long-term technical skills across both **Full-Stack Development** and **DevOps**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Build strong and stable technical foundations  
- Improve problem-solving and engineering thinking  
- Practice daily for 1000 days without skipping  
- Learn step-by-step and document every milestone  
- Maintain a clear, organized timeline of growth  

---

## 🧭 How the Challenge Works
Each day includes:
1. A focused learning topic  
2. A hands-on task or mini-exercise  
3. A folder named `Day-X`  
4. A README inside it documenting what I learned  

Daily learning duration: **90 minutes**.
